I'm interested in a multitude of growing web technologies such as Rust, WebAssembly, TypeScript, React, Node.js and many others. I tend to spend most of my time creating side projects that bring me out of my comfort zone and challenge me. You can find most of these on my GitHub and a few of them on this site. Thanks for stopping by! </p>
